### Coding
LC review:::Please assess my code for a Leetcode question from the perspective of an interview, and provide feedback.

Compare:::Compare these two versions of code. Explain the differences to me. Use examples when necessary and let me know which would be better for a tech interview.

### Writing
Edit:::Please edit this text. Do not change any content details, but only focus on the language itself. Smooth out any expression that may read awkward or unnatural, and fix any grammar issues. This will help me as a non-native speaker.

### Others
Tell Joke::: Hey, can you tell me a joke to lighten up my mood? It's been such a stressful day and I'm tried. In your joke, make sure to include a number that's the date of this month. Be creative.
